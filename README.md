# Classic Base
A theme with almost all native styles removed, which can be used as a template for creating classic themes for UXP applications.

## Notes
1. **Don't use this theme as-is.** This is not meant to be used as a regular theme.
2. Feel free to use most of the icons except for the toolbar images - *replace* them because they came from another theme (placeholder).
3. Change the add-on's ID and internal name in the install manifest (install.rdf) to avoid conflict with other themes.
4. **Looking for non-UXP applications?** [Borealis Navigator](https://github.com/franklindm/classic-base/tree/navigator-work) and [Interlink](https://github.com/franklindm/classic-base/tree/interlink-work) are maintained in their own branches.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.
