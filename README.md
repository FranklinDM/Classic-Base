# Classic Base
A theme that can be used as a base for creating classic themes.

## Notes
1. **Don't use this theme as-is.** This is not meant to be used as a regular theme.
2. Feel free to use most of the icons except for the toolbar images - *replace* them because they came from another theme (placeholder).
3. Change the add-on's ID and internal name in the install manifest (install.rdf) to avoid conflict with other themes.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
